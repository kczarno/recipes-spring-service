# Recipes

The program that stores all recipes in one place. Multi-user web service with Spring Boot that allows storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting recipes.
Endpoint ```POST /api/register``` receives a JSON object with two fields: ```email (string)```, and ```password (string)```. If a user with a specified email does not exist, the program saves (registers) the user in a database and responds with ```200 (Ok)```. If a user is already in the database, respond with the ```400 (Bad Request)``` status code. Both fields are required and must be valid: email should contain ```@``` and ```.``` symbols, password should contain at least ```8 characters``` and shouldn't be blank. If the fields do not meet these restrictions, the service should respond with ```400 (Bad Request)```.
Only an author of a recipe can delete or update a recipe. If a user is not the author of a recipe, but they try to carry out the actions mentioned above, the service should respond with the ```403 (Forbidden)``` status code.
